# Bus Schedule App

The goal of this practical work (TP) is to develop a simple application that displays bus arrival times from a pre-filled database. Initially, it will show the arrival times of a bus line in a RecyclerView. In the next step, the objective is to display specific arrival times for the selected bus station.

Throughout this TP, we explored:

- Fundamentals of using Room.
- The ListAdapter class, an alternative way to present data in a RecyclerView.
- MVVM architecture.
- LiveData for reactive storage and observation of data.
- Usage of fragments and navigation with Jetpack Compose Navigation component.
